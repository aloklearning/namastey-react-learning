# Namastey React Learning

A project created to learn in-depth of React fundamentals while creating a production ready app from the course [Namastey React](https://namastedev.com/learn/namaste-react) ðŸš€, created by Akshay Saini.

## Parcel

Parcel as a bundler does a lot of things for us, which eventually makes the project faster and ready for production, comprising of:

- Dev Build
- Code Splitting
- Error Handling
- Hosting on HTTPS
- Bundling the app
- Consistent Hashing
- Image Optimisations
- Caching (.parcel-cache)
- Local Server for building
- Tree Shaking: Removing unused codes
- Different bundles for Dev and Production
- Hot Module Replacements (HMR)
  - File Watching Algorithm ( Written in C++)
- Differential Bundling: Supporting older browser
- Minification/Compression to reduce the bundle size
