# Namastey React Learning

A project created to learn in-depth of React fundamentals while creating a production ready app from the course [Namastey React](https://namastedev.com/learn/namaste-react) ðŸš€, created by Akshay Saini.

# Why React is Fast?

- React has a capability of updating the changes quickly to the UI.
- It does this by keeping a constant sync between the **Data Layer** and the **UI Layer**.
- The responsible algorithm is called, **reconcilliation** or **diffing** algorithm. What it does
  is, creating a `virtual dom (old)` and keep comparing it to the newly created one `virtual dom (new)`.
  Once it identifies what to change exactly, it then applies that only change while re-rendering the UI.
- **React Fibre** a new and enhanced feature of React helps behind the background. It uses **Reconcilliation**
  only, but also use a incremental rendering, which means, it can split the rendering to different windows, and
  render, on demand. This helps it do prioritisation and implementation smooth, making it faster then the other
  libraries and frameworks.
